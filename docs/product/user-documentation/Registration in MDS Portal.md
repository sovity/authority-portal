# Registration in MDS-Portal

## User Registration
Registration to the MDS as a user can be done on two ways:
-	Self-registration
-	By receiving an invitation
### Self registration
Self-registration is only suitable for the first user of an organization within the MDS Portal. 
Start the process on the MDS Dataspace Authority Portal. Click on “Register” and follow the registration process. You will be asked to provide information about the user and the organization. You will not be able to edit this information later!

After clicking "Submit", the MDS will receive the registration request. Once the request is validated, you will receive a verification email.

Once received, click on the verification link in the email and wait for your organization to be approved or rejected by the Data Space Authority.

### Invitation
Within the Authority Portal the Profile page provides an overview of your organization's information and by clicking on “User list” it displays a list of all registered users in your organization. From there, you can invite and register new users to your organization.

To invite new users into your organization, you must have the role of Participant_Admin!

Click on "Invite new User" and specify the user's name, email and role. Click on "Submit" to add the user to the list of registered users.

The invited user will receive an invitation email with a link. When clicking the link, the user will be asked to set a password for their account and required to add a two-factor authentication.

## Organization registration
There are two ways to register with MDS as an organization:
-	Self-registration (see User registration – Self-registration)
-	Invitations
### Organization invitations
Invitations for organizations can only be sent by the Data Space Authority (MDS). 
The process is as follows:
1.	The Data Space Authority (MDS) sends an organization invitation to an organization representative. 
2.	The organization representative receives an e-mail with a link to the user registration process (see User Self-Registration).
3.	The invited person completes the missing user details for his profile.

The organization representative invited by the MDS will automatically be accepted and assigned with the Participation_Admin role.
