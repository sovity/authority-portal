## About this Extension

The Catalog Crawler is an additional deployment unit needed to determine the online status of registered connectors and populate the Data Catalog:

- It is a modified EDC connector with the task to crawl the other connectors' public data offers.
- It periodically checks the Authority Portal's connector list for its environment.
- It crawls the given connectors in regular intervals.
- It writes the data offers and connector statuses into the Authority Portal DB.
- Each environment configured in the Authority Portal requires its own Catalog Crawler with credentials for that environment's DAPS.

## Why does this component exist?

The Authority Portal uses a non-EDC stack and thus it cannot read the catalogs of participating connectors directly.

## Deployment

Please see the [Productive Deployment Guide](../../docs/deployment-guide/goals/production/README.md) for more information.
