### Deployment Migration Notes

Read the deployment migration notes carefully if you want to retain the portal's current behavior.
If you configure the optional variables incorrectly, you might end up with an inconsistent configuration.

#### Backend

Environment variable changes:

- Renamed variables:
  - `authority-portal.caas.sovity.limit-per-mdsid` to `authority-portal.caas.sovity.limit-per-organization`
- New optional configuration variables - the values assigned here are the ones you should use to retain the current behavior:
  - ```yaml
    # Organization ID configuration (example: prefix: MDS & length: 4 would generate Ids in the format MDSL1234XX)
    # The 'L' stands for 'Legal' and is added automatically after the prefix - the last 2 characters are the checksum
    authority-portal.organization.id.prefix: "MDS"
    authority-portal.organization.id.length: "4"
    ```
- New **mandatory** configuration variables:
  - ```yaml
    # Enables the client to connect to the CaaS service. If you weren't provided credentials for the feature by sovity, set this to false
    quarkus.oidc-client.sovity.client-enabled: true
    ```

#### Frontend

Environment variable changes:

- New **mandantory** configuration variables - the values assigned here are the ones you should use to retain the current behavior:
  - ```yaml
    # UI Branding profile
    AUTHORITY_PORTAL_FRONTEND_ACTIVE_PROFILE: mds-open-source
    # Short Dataspace name, used in some explanatory texts
    AUTHORITY_PORTAL_FRONTEND_DATASPACE_SHORT_NAME: MDS
    # Portal name displayed in various texts
    AUTHORITY_PORTAL_FRONTEND_PORTAL_DISPLAY_NAME: "MDS Portal"
    ```

- Portal Backend

  - Following environment variables have been added and **must be configured** for each environment

    - ```yaml
      # Time after which offline data offers are hidden from the Data Catalog
      authority-portal.deployment.environments.{environmentId}.data-catalog.hide-offline-data-offers-after: 15m

      # Default page size for the Data Catalog
      authority-portal.deployment.environments.{environmentId}.data-catalog.catalog-page-page-size: 10

      # Kuma name for the catalog crawler
      authority-portal.deployment.environments.{environmentId}.data-catalog.kuma-name: broker

      # Environment Connector-Dataspace association
      # Allows certain connectors to be associated as partnered data spaces
      # Required: Default Dataspace name
      authority-portal.deployment.environments.test.data-catalog.dataspace-names.default: MDS
      # Optional: Additional connectors to be given a dataspace name
      authority-portal.deployment.environments.test.data-catalog.dataspace-names.connectorIds."MDSL1234XX.C1234XX": Mobilithek
      ```

  - Following environment variables have been removed and **can be removed from the configuration**
    - ```yaml
      # the broker has been removed, as the catalog is now a part of the authority portal
      authority-portal.deployment.environments.{environmentId}.broker.url: ...
      authority-portal.deployment.environments.{environmentId}.broker.admin-api-key: ...
      authority-portal.deployment.environments.{environmentId}.broker.api-key: ...
      authority-portal.deployment.environments.{environmentId}.broker.kuma-name: ...
      ```

- The Broker as a stand-alone deployment unit has been removed in favor of the Catalog Crawler.
  - Any broker's database is not required anymore and can be undeployed.
  - A Catalog Crawler must be deployed for each environment to fill the catalog with live data.
  - Just like the broker, the Catalog Crawler is a modified EDC connector. As such, it can only fetch the catalogs from connectors registered in the same DAPS environment.
  - There is a dedicated [Catalog Crawler Productive Deployment Guide](https://github.com/sovity/edc-ce/blob/v10.0.0/docs/deployment-guide/goals/catalog-crawler-production/README.md)
  - Running Uptime Kuma instances must be reconfigured to track the status of the catalog crawler instead of the Broker.
  - While the Catalog Crawler is similar to the broker, please note, that many environment variables have been renamed or removed. It is recommended to do a fresh deployment using the deployment guide.
