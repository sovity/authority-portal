## About The Project

The **Authority Portal** is an open-source Software as a Service (SaaS) solution designed to streamline the management of your Dataspace. This innovative tool serves as a comprehensive Dataspace Administration Tool, offering a platform where you can seamlessly invite organizations and their users to participate in your Dataspace.

The Authority Portal is not just about managing participants. It also provides multiple avenues to add or acquire connectors and service partners. These partners can offer their own Connector-as-a-Service (CaaS), extending the functionality and versatility of your Dataspace.

As a Dataspace administration tool, the Authority Portal necessitates technical connections with other dataspace components, including the CaaS component. This integration ensures a smooth and efficient operation, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Development

To develop new features, once the API definitions are implemented
in the backend, the development of both the frontend and backend can start in parallel.

The frontend has a type-safe fake backend which also uses the API models via an autogenerated TypeScript API Client
Library.

Once a feature is implemented in both the frontend and backend, it can be manually tested
using [Local E2E Development](#local-e2e-development).

### Local Development

The backend and the frontend can be developed separately:

- [Local Backend Development](authority-portal-backend/README.md#development)
- [Local Frontend Development](authority-portal-frontend/README.md#development)

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Local E2E Development

Local E2E Development is what you use to integration test the backend and frontend locally. Requires JDK17, a Docker
Environment and Node 16 / NPM 7.

```shell
# Bash, WSL or Git Bash

# Build + Run Backend
(cd authority-portal-backend && ./gradlew clean quarkusDev)

# Build + Run Frontend (basic version with fake Backend*)
(cd authority-portal-frontend && npm i && npm run cold-start-e2e-dev)
```

For more details on how to launch the frontend,
see [Frontend Local E2E Development](authority-portal-frontend/README.md#local-e2e-development).
